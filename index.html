The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. 
The WHO Constitution, which establishes the agency's governing structure and principles, states its main objective as "the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health."<br>
 It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with six semi-autonomous regional offices and 150 field offices worldwide.
<br>
The WHO was established by constitution on 7 April 1948,
 which is commemorated as World Health Day.<br>
The first meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the agency's governing body, took place on 24 July 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organisation and the Office International d'Hygi√®ne Publique, including the International Classification of Diseases.
 Its work began in earnest in 1951 following a significant infusion of financial and technical resources.
<br><br>
The WHO's broad mandate includes advocating for universal healthcare, monitoring public health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting human health and well being. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards and guidelines, and collects data on global health issues through the World Health Survey. Its flagship publication, the World Health Report, provides expert assessments of global health topics and health statistics on all nations.The WHO also serves as a forum for summits and discussions on health issues.

Working with the regions</h2>
<h3>Regional Offices</h3><hr>
<p>WHO Member States are grouped into six regions. These regions are organizational groupings and, while they are based on geographical terms, are not synonymous with geographical areas. Note that the WHO regions are not the same as those of the United Nations.</p>
<ul>
<li> WHO African Region</li>
<li> WHO Region for the Americas</li>
 <li>WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region</li>
<li>WHO European Region</li>
<li> WHO South-East Asia Region</li>
<li> WHO Western Pacific Region</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each WHO region has a regional office. Regional offices are actively developing and implementing chronic disease prevention and control strategies in association with country offices as part of WHO's global response to the prevention and control of chronic, noncommunicable diseases. The development of these strategies is at different stages in each region. See below the websites of regional offices for more information on strategies.
